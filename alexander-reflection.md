What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with understanding the entire Git workflow. I was also fuzzy about the differences between a new branch and the master file. Finally, I was a little confused about what pulling and merging requests really meant. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Adding and committing changes became a lot more clear to me, as well as the differences between various git commands. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Some of the questions I had were - what is the difference between the branch and the master file? Do you need to create a new directory when you download a new repo, or does it automatically create a directory? I was also unsure about how to put the screenshot into the Sublime text, so I asked my pair that. 

What still confuses you about git?
I am still confused about the workflow. I am mastering it but I do not have all of the steps down, and I know the steps can change depending on what you are working on and what you need to push. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My first experience of pairing in a GPS was great! It was really helpful to talk about the challenge and work through the kinks together. It was also really helpful to meet the guide, Helin.
